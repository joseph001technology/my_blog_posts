  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <h5>üëã Hey there!</h5>
  <p> 
<strong>Welcome to my space on the web!</strong>
<br><br>
I‚Äôm currently a student pursuing a Bachelor of Business Information Technology (BBIT) ‚Äî a unique intersection of business and tech that‚Äôs helped shape my approach to solving real-world problems through code. Along the way, I‚Äôve grown into a full-stack web developer, with hands-on experience building intuitive, scalable, and responsive applications across both frontend and backend.
<br><br>
This site is a blend of my journey, projects, experiments, and thoughts as I continue evolving in the world of software development. Here, you‚Äôll find personal and technical blog posts, as well as a portfolio of the projects I‚Äôve worked on ‚Äî from practical business tools to problem-solving platforms aimed at real users. I build not just to learn, but to create things that matter.
<br><br>
üíª <strong>What I Do</strong>
<br>
While still a student, I‚Äôve actively taken on freelance and personal projects that mimic real-world complexity ‚Äî building CRUD systems, blog platforms, USSD-driven tools, crop marketplace apps for farmers, and more. I focus on clean architecture, efficient data flow, and user-first design.
<br><br>
 
I enjoy working on end-to-end web applications, from setting up backend logic and APIs, to designing sleek and responsive frontends.
<br><br>
üåç <strong>Why I Build</strong>
  <br>
I‚Äôm passionate about building solutions that are simple, impactful, and real. I often explore ideas that empower underrepresented communities ‚Äî such as creating tech tools for small-scale farmers or simplifying digital access through mobile-first solutions.
<br><br>
As someone learning both the technical and business side of tech, I‚Äôm drawn to projects that require thoughtful integration of systems, scalability, and user strategy.
<br><br>
üß† <strong>Always Learning</strong>
<br>
Technology moves fast ‚Äî and I enjoy keeping pace. Outside of formal coursework, I constantly explore new tools and frameworks, and dive into topics like APIs, authentication, deployment, and automation. Whether I‚Äôm debugging a stubborn Django error or experimenting with a new UI approach, I treat every challenge as an opportunity to grow.
<br><br>
‚ú®<strong> Beyond the Code </strong>
When I‚Äôm not buried in VS Code or pushing commits to GitHub, you‚Äôll find me:
<br>
Brainstorming side projects
<br>
Reading about tech, business, or philosophy
<br>
Taking walks, listening to music, or exploring new places
<br>
Connecting with other devs and sharing ideas
<br><br>
 
üôå <strong> Let‚Äôs Build Something Awesome </strong>
<br>
I‚Äôm just getting started ‚Äî and the best projects are yet to come. Whether you‚Äôre a fellow developer, student, or someone with an idea to build out, I‚Äôd love to connect.
<br>
Let‚Äôs create solutions that are functional, elegant, and built to last.</p>
