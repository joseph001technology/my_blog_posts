    <h2 class="section-title">About Me</h2>
    <p><strong>Welcome to my space on the web!</strong></p>
    <p>I‚Äôm currently a student pursuing a Bachelor of Business Information Technology (BBIT) ‚Äî a unique intersection of business and tech that‚Äôs helped shape my approach to solving real-world problems through code. Along the way, I‚Äôve grown into a full-stack web developer, with hands-on experience building intuitive, scalable, and responsive applications across both frontend and backend.</p>
    <p>This site is a blend of my journey, projects, experiments, and thoughts as I continue evolving in the world of software development. Here, you‚Äôll find personal and technical blog posts, as well as a portfolio of the projects I‚Äôve worked on ‚Äî from practical business tools to problem-solving platforms aimed at real users. I build not just to learn, but to create things that matter.</p>
    <p>üíª <strong>What I Do</strong><br>
    While still a student, I‚Äôve actively taken on freelance and personal projects that mimic real-world complexity ‚Äî building CRUD systems, blog platforms, USSD-driven tools, crop marketplace apps for farmers, and more. I focus on clean architecture, efficient data flow, and user-first design.</p>
    <p>I enjoy working on end-to-end web applications, from setting up backend logic and APIs, to designing sleek and responsive frontends.</p>
    <p>üåç <strong>Why I Build</strong><br>
    I‚Äôm passionate about building solutions that are simple, impactful, and real. I often explore ideas that empower underrepresented communities ‚Äî such as creating tech tools for small-scale farmers or simplifying digital access through mobile-first solutions.</p>
    <p>As someone learning both the technical and business side of tech, I‚Äôm drawn to projects that require thoughtful integration of systems, scalability, and user strategy.</p>
    <p>üß† <strong>Always Learning</strong><br>
    Technology moves fast ‚Äî and I enjoy keeping pace. Outside of formal coursework, I constantly explore new tools and frameworks, and dive into topics like APIs, authentication, deployment, and automation. Whether I‚Äôm debugging a stubborn Django error or experimenting with a new UI approach, I treat every challenge as an opportunity to grow.</p>
    <p>‚ú® <strong>Beyond the Code</strong><br>
    When I‚Äôm not buried in VS Code or pushing commits to GitHub, you‚Äôll find me:<br>
    Brainstorming side projects<br>
    Reading about tech, business, or philosophy<br>
    Taking walks, listening to music, or exploring new places<br>
    Connecting with other devs and sharing ideas</p>
    <p>üôå <strong>Let‚Äôs Build Something Awesome</strong><br>
    I‚Äôm just getting started ‚Äî and the best projects are yet to come. Whether you‚Äôre a fellow developer, student, or someone with an idea to build out, I‚Äôd love to connect.
    Let‚Äôs create solutions that are functional, elegant, and built to last.</p>
